          The source table containing the loaded and flattened nodes (including tests, seeds, sources, models and
          exposures) from manifest.json loaded artifacts. Note that within the raw manifest file, exposures and sources
          are stored seperately from seeds, models and tests, but for convenience they are all flattened to a single table
          for this package.
          
          This belongs to the V2 upload. See the README for more info.
